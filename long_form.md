I am a interdisciplinary artist[^1], and I work mainly with humble materials[^3] and appropriation[^4]. I make objects[^5]. The objects are ephemeral, temporary, interventions, and performances made from humble materials, and are meant to inspire dialogical interaction on the contemporary state of labor and power relationships.

This last pharagraph makes it sound like I have things figured out. All that I have are questions[^6]. Each project leads to more questions. And these questions all seem to be grouping themslves around a few central subjects immaterial labor and power relations in society. The animus of my work is dialogue, which leads to transformative thinking.  

The outcome is a humorous juxtaposition that is simultaneously critical and celebratory; leaving the viewer with a recognition of the networks that they operate within and a tool through which to reimagine those relationships. Providing a bridge between digital and physical networks has been one of the thought tools my work employs to investigate problematic systems.
 
From its very beginning, digital culture has taken an open, remix ethos.[^7]

This is exemplified in my piece #gameofthecentury. This work was an interactive installation consisting of custom software that was continually searching twitter for new mentions of the Marxist or Capitalist economists who made up the two fictional soccer teams that I had created. The viewer interacted with all the trappings of a soccer match: the game programme with each teams‚Äô rosters, the teams‚Äô pennants, the bleachers, and the scoreboard. The scoreboard was continually updated to reflect the events that took place in the digital game. The game existed in the minds of those in the crowd and in the hearts of those tweeting their beliefs. The game was was loosely based on Monty Python‚Äôs philosophical soccer match and tried to retain the same humor. It was also able to critically engage with the a variety of concepts through exploring, for instance, the fact that most of us have never read the ideas critical of our system or the ideas that are the foundation of our economic system.

[^1]:By interdisciplinary I mean that I am a conceptual artist[^2] who moves between mediums and modes of making. The mediums that I usally deploy are printmaking, sculpture, and photography, and the modes that work in are usally interactive, openeded, and social. 

I’m a new media artist who makes analog objects.
