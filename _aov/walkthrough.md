# Greeting 

The visitor walks up to the library and is greeted by the librarian on duty. The librarian spends most of their time making the library, but when a visitor arrives they are their highest priority. It is similar to an honored guest visiting your home.


# Walk Around / Describe the organization

[as the librarian walks the guest around the library]

This is a library, but it is not like most of the libraries that you may have visited. It contains books, but they are completely unique. The books fall into five major categories, and each of these categories is placed so that as you move from left to right the level of abstraction increases. This may seem strange to speak of abstraction when it comes to books, but these books are all made exclusively for this library and the process of their creation abstracts them in these five ways

# Ask to remix

In addition to these five categories there is a anthology of the most important parts of the library. This anthology is created with the help of the patrons of the library. The copy machine is at your disposal for free both for your help in the creation of this anthology and for you to check out the library and take it home. [all the copies are on half sheets the same size as the books.]

# they sit and read make notes

The desks are a shared work space that is set aside for both reading and writing (which may be spoken of as one act). The tools for notes are paper note pads with subtle formatting as a guid for their use.[^451] 

# add to project

the ideal senario would mean that the library gets stuck in peoples mind and they come back cause they can't get a book or an idea out of their mind

[^1]:they are left with an understanding of the way in which their action of reading is a form of remix, and that they are liberated to remix more fully the things in their life.
