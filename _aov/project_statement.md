Anthony Warnick's project _The Library_ has all of the elements that one expects in a library: books, tables, shelves, and a card catalogue system. But it is unlike any other library in that all the books that it contains are originals. Each of these books are altered. The books are produced by the librarian one by one with the belief that for each book there is an ideal reader, and for each reader their ideal book. The goal of the library is to liberate the thoughts of each of the readers. The death of the author has given the reader a prime place, and the text is simply a starting point from which more and more can be built. The books are altered by a piece of custom software. Each books is produced in one of five styles: the first style is that of a screenplay or dialogue, the second is poetry, the third is reduction of the text to one sentence, the fourth is a computer translation of the text, and the fifth is a reduction of the text to just a list of the each word and the number of times it appears in the book. Each books represents the shoulders of giants on which the reader is able to stand.

I make work to investigate and question.

Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and ... the alteration of men on a mass scale is, necessary, ... a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.(Marx, German Ideology (1845))
