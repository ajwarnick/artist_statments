a.) colleagues in your immediate circle of art practice---the folks who already understand what you do. 

I am a interdisciplinary artist. My work is primarily conceptual social practice. The objects are ephemeral, temporary, interventions, and performances made from humble materials, and are meant to inspire dialogical interaction on the contemporary state of labor and power relationships. 


b.) artists or arts people outside of your discipline


I am a conceptual artist who works primarily with humble materials - newsprint and plywood - and appropriation - mainly from mid-20th century art. My work engages with the concepts of immaterial labor and power relations in society. The animus of my work is dialogue, which leads to transformative thinking. 


c.) adults who aren't artists or arts patrons 


I make objects and do actions. These are focused on ideas about labor and society. Most of the time the things that I make are made out of very humble materials like newsprint and plywood, and heavily reference 20th century art history. Dialogue inspired by the objects and actions is the most important part.


d.) kids 


I make objects and do actions. These are focused on ideas about work and relationships between people. The things that I make are made out of very humble materials like newsprint and plywood. Conversation, caused by the things I make, is the most important part.
