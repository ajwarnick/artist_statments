## Greeting 

The visitor walks up to the library and is greeted by the librarian on duty. The librarian spends most of their time making the library, but when a visitor arrives they are their highest priority. It is similar to an honored guest visiting your home. The guests are asked to contribute things that they make to an anthology. 


## Walk Around / Describe the organization

[as the librarian walks the guest around the library they explain the process of the library. This can be short of long depending on time]

###### long
This is a library, but it is not like most of the libraries that you may have visited. It contains books, but they are completely unique. The books fall into five major categories, and each of these categories is placed so that as you move from left to right the level of abstraction increases. This may seem strange to speak of abstraction when it comes to books, but these books are all made exclusively for this library and the process of their creation abstracts them in these five ways. They are all remixes of preexisting books, and in many ways they retain the trace and residue of those original books. But they are  
###### short
This is a library that is comprised of five type of abstractions, and they are all remixes of other books and new books in their own way. Please stay a while and remix what is here take what ever you want and add to our anthology. 

## Ask to remix

In addition to these five categories there is a anthology of the most important parts of the library. This anthology is created with the help of the patrons of the library. The copy machine is at your disposal for free both for your help in the creation of this anthology and for you to check out the library and take it home. [all the copies are on half sheets the same size as the books.]

## they sit and read make notes

The desks are a shared work space that is set aside for both reading and writing (which may be spoken of as one act). The tools for notes are paper note pads with subtle formatting as a guid for their use.[^451] 

## add to project

The anthology of the project is made from things that are found by the public and collated into a book. They are ask at the beginning to add to this anthology. They are not required to and their addition can be whatever they like just a page from one of the books in the library, a drawing on one of the note book pages, or a cut up of photocopies to make a new remix. 

## return

the ideal scenario would mean that the library gets stuck in peoples mind and they come back cause they can't get a book or an idea out of their mind. They return looking for a certain book or a style.

I was hoping to be accepting submissions from the public for books to be adding to the library. As the guest leaves the librarian asks them if there is any books they would like to the library.
